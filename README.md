# EarthMC-Griefer-check-mod

Checks who deleted ur base/items like chests you can select them.
lists possible people who griefed your items with my **PRIVATE** API. Which checks for people who break blocks in a chosen coordinates. It can check stuff from the past but not as accurately.
Also PLEASE DO NOT RUN THIS WITH ANY ANTIVIRUS ON, this is because the file does not have a proper signature meaning most anti-viruses flag this. Linux port soon.
